# DERSAD-Database
The Database of Early Rainfall Season Atlantic Dust (DERSAD) was a dataset developed by LSU Coastal Meteorology graduate student Hank Dolce. It covers Saharan Air Layer outbreaks during the Puerto Rican early rainfall season, lasting from April 1 through July 31. SALs were detected using MERRA-2 integrated dust transport data and 85th percentile atmospheric river detection methodologies. Each file is a binary dataset such that grid cells included in a DERSAD SAL are assigned the value "1" and those not in a DERSAD SAL are labeled "0".

Files uploaded by season due to GitHub file size limit.

Files entitled "DERSAD_Spring_[Year]" encompass April and May data for that year.
Files entitled "DERSAD_Summer_[Year]" encompass June and July data for that year.
