# DERSAD-Database
Saharan dust database during the Puerto Rican early rainfall season (April through July) using integrated dust transport and 85th percentile AAR methodologies.

Files uploaded by season due to GitHub file size limit.

Each file is a binary dataset such that grid cells included in a DERSAD SAL are assigned the value "1" and those not in a DERSAD SAL are labeled "0".

Files entitled "DERSAD_Spring_[Year]" encompass April and May data for that year.
Files entitled "DERSAD_Summer_[Year]" encompass June and July data for that year.
